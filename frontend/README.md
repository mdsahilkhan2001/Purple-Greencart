## üìå Project Overview & Purpose
This application is a **logistics management and simulation tool** designed for managers to:
- Manage **Drivers, Routes, and Orders** through an intuitive dashboard.
- Run **AI-based delivery simulations** considering driver fatigue, traffic conditions, penalties, and bonuses.
- Track **KPIs** such as total profit, efficiency score, fuel cost breakdown, and on-time vs. late deliveries.
- **Authenticate** securely so only authorized managers can access simulations and data.
- Save simulation results with timestamps and view a **history of past runs**.

This tool helps optimize delivery efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve decision-making in logistics operations.
